# Trainual Training Platform: Streamline Onboarding, Centralize SOPs, Scale Faster

You know that chaos when a new hire asks "where's the process for X?" and three different people give three different answers? That's the exact headache Trainual was built to solve.

Think of it as your company's instruction manual—except instead of collecting dust in some forgotten Google Drive folder, it's actually alive, searchable, and people use it every day. Every process, every policy, every "this is how we do things around here" lives in one spot. New teammates get up to speed faster. Managers stop answering the same questions on repeat. And you finally have a single source of truth that doesn't require archaeology skills to navigate.

## What Makes Trainual Different From Just Another LMS

Here's the thing about most learning management systems: they're built for training companies or massive enterprises with dedicated L&D teams. Trainual took a different route. They asked, "What if small and growing teams could document how work actually gets done, then turn that into training people actually complete?"

The result feels less like corporate training software and more like the wiki your team would build if they had unlimited time and patience. You can drop in step-by-step guides, embed screen recordings, add quizzes to make sure people actually get it, and track who's done what without manually chasing everyone down.

What really clicks for most teams is how Trainual connects roles to responsibilities to actual training content. Instead of generic courses, each person gets a personalized learning path based on their job. Sales reps see sales processes. Operations folks see operations workflows. Nobody wastes time on stuff that doesn't apply to them.

The AI-powered search is honestly pretty slick too. Someone types "how many PTO days do I get?" and Trainual surfaces the exact policy, instantly. No digging through multiple tabs or hoping you remembered the right document title.

## The Real Numbers: Trainual Pricing Breakdown for 2026

Trainual operates on a seat-based annual subscription model with four main tiers. Here's what you're actually looking at:

| Plan | Base Price | Included Seats | Best For | Key Features |
|------|-----------|----------------|----------|--------------|
| **Core** | Starting at $249/month (annual billing) | 10 seats | Small teams getting started with documentation | AI-assisted docs, 500+ templates, group training, testing & tracking, mobile app, 30-day version history |
| **Pro** | Custom quote (historically ~$319/month) | 10 seats | Teams wanting individual training paths | Everything in Core + individual training paths, 15GB video storage, 300 e-signatures/year, org chart, delegation planner, 90-day version history, CSM |

**Additional Costs to Know:**

- **Extra Seats:** $3-$5 per additional seat/month depending on plan tier
- **Premium Course Library:** Available as paid add-on (400+ pre-built HR & compliance courses)

The pricing structure is transparent, but note that Trainual now uses quote-based pricing rather than publishing exact costs publicly. Teams typically need to 👉 [book a demo](https://trainual.com) to get specific numbers based on their size and needs.

**Potential Savings:** Various promo codes circulate offering 10-15% off annual plans, and nonprofit organizations can access a 50% discount. G2 buyers have access to exclusive 10% off deals through their marketplace.

## Feature Highlights: What You Actually Get

**Documentation That Doesn't Suck:**
Creating SOPs in Trainual feels more like writing a blog post than filling out enterprise software forms. The editor is clean, supports rich media (videos, GIFs, images, screen recordings), and you can knock out a solid process doc in under 30 minutes. The built-in screen recorder means you can capture workflows as you're doing them—no separate tool needed.

The real standout is the 500+ customizable templates. Starting a new policy on remote work? PTO? Customer service escalations? There's probably a template for it. Just grab it, tweak it to match your reality, and you're done.

**AI-Powered Everything:**
Trainual's AI capabilities go beyond basic search. Describe what process you need documented, and AI generates a structured draft you can refine. Want quizzes to reinforce learning? AI creates them based on your content. Need to map out your org chart? AI suggestions based on team structure.

The search function uses natural language processing, so employees can ask questions like actual humans instead of guessing exact keywords. This alone saves managers countless "where do I find..." interruptions.

**Training That People Actually Complete:**
You can assign training by individual, role, department, or location. Set due dates. Require e-signatures for critical policies. Add tests and quizzes. Track completion rates in real-time dashboards.

The gamification features (badges, completion celebrations) sound cheesy but genuinely seem to help with engagement. And the mobile app means people can knock out training during commutes or downtime without needing their laptop.

**Accountability Built In:**
The org chart and role chart features aren't just pretty diagrams. They connect directly to responsibilities and training content. When someone asks "who handles X?" you can point them to the chart. When a role changes, you update it once and the connected training paths adjust automatically.

The Delegation Planner (Pro tier and above) helps leaders map where team members should and shouldn't spend time. It's basically a visual guide to "stop doing that, start doing this" without endless meetings.

## What Real Users Are Actually Saying

Trainual consistently pulls strong ratings across review platforms:

- **G2:** 4.7/5 from 900+ reviews
- **Capterra:** 4.7/5 with 99% rating it 4-5 stars
- **Overall Satisfaction:** Ranks among top-rated onboarding and SOP platforms

**The praise tends to cluster around a few themes:**

"We've solved the problem of making sure each new employee has ALL the info they need," one creative director noted. The ability to centralize everything resonates strongly with teams tired of scattered documentation.

Operations managers particularly appreciate the tracking visibility. "I love the ability to automate and streamline onboarding, which saves valuable time I can spend on other business operations," reported one user managing multiple locations.

The implementation support gets consistent callouts. "The implementation specialist listened to our story and provided direction without overwhelming us," a reviewer shared. That $1,000 implementation fee apparently buys actual hands-on help, not just access to documentation.

**Common friction points:**

Some users find the content categorization rigid. "Sometimes the structure means items needing one page require a folder and subfolder," one reviewer observed. It's designed for organization, which occasionally conflicts with simplicity.

Pricing is a sticking point for smaller teams or nonprofits not using full capacity. "The pricing model doesn't include all features unless you pay premium right off the bat," noted one user who wanted advanced functions without the top-tier commitment.

Mobile experience gets mixed feedback. The app works well for consuming content and tracking progress, but creating or editing material on mobile is clunky. Definitely a "build on desktop, review on mobile" situation.

## Integration Ecosystem: Does It Play Nice With Your Stack?

Trainual connects with the tools most growing teams already use:

**HR & Payroll Systems:**
- Gusto
- BambooHR
- Zenefits
- Justworks

These integrations automatically add new hires to Trainual when they're added to your HRIS, keeping your employee directory synced without manual updates.

**Identity & Access:**
- Okta
- Microsoft Entra (Azure AD)
- Google Workspace

Single sign-on support means one less password for employees to remember and better security controls for IT.

**Communication & Workflow:**
- Slack (search Trainual directly from Slack)
- Zapier (connect to 1,000+ other apps)
- Chrome Extension (access Trainual from any browser tab)

**Content Tools:**
- Loom (embedded screen recordings)
- Google Docs/Word (upload existing docs directly)
- GIPHY (make training actually engaging)

The integrations aren't as extensive as enterprise LMS platforms, but they cover the essentials for most teams under 500 employees.

## Who Should (and Shouldn't) Use Trainual

**Trainual makes sense if:**

You're hiring frequently and onboarding eats manager time. If you're bringing on 3+ people per quarter and managers spend weeks getting each one up to speed, Trainual can cut that ramp time significantly.

Your processes live in people's heads. When the person who "just knows how we do things" takes vacation and everything grinds to a halt, that's your sign. Trainual forces that knowledge out of brains and onto paper.

You're in a compliance-heavy industry. The e-signature features, progress tracking, and audit trails matter for healthcare, finance, legal services, and other regulated fields.

You're scaling multiple locations or remote teams. Consistency across offices or distributed teammates gets exponentially harder without centralized systems. Trainual keeps everyone rowing in the same direction.

**Trainual might not fit if:**

You need deeper analytics and reporting. The dashboards show completion rates and progress, but data nerds wanting extensive behavioral analytics or advanced learning paths might find it limiting.

Your budget is extremely tight. Starting at ~$250/month plus implementation feels steep for teams under 10 people, especially if you're not hiring aggressively. The ROI calculation depends heavily on how much manager time you're currently burning on training.

You want extensive customization. While Trainual offers branding options and custom domains on higher tiers, teams needing deeply personalized learning experiences or complex conditional logic may bump into limitations.

## Current Promotions & Discounts for 2026

While Trainual doesn't blast constant sales, several discount opportunities exist:

**Active Promo Codes:**
- **G2 Marketplace Exclusive:** 10% off any annual plan for first year (requires signing up through G2 landing page)
- **General Discount Codes:** Various verified codes offering 10-15% off circulate on coupon sites, though availability varies
- **Newsletter Signup:** Some reports indicate instant 20% off codes for email subscribers

**Special Programs:**
- **Nonprofit Discount:** 50% off for qualified nonprofit organizations (documentation required)
- **EO Member Discount:** 15% off for Entrepreneurs' Organization members
- **Annual vs Monthly:** Choosing annual billing over monthly saves approximately 15-17% across all tiers

**Important note:** Trainual has shifted to demo-based, quote-driven pricing, so the best deals often come through 👉 [direct conversation with their sales team](https://trainual.com) rather than public coupon codes.

## The Bottom Line: Is Trainual Worth It?

For teams actively hiring and struggling with inconsistent onboarding, Trainual delivers solid ROI. The platform won't magically organize your business, but it gives you the structure to capture how work gets done, then systematically teach it to new people.

The pricing sits above many LMS alternatives, but you're paying for simplicity and purpose-built functionality. This isn't enterprise software trying to be everything to everyone—it's specifically designed for the "we're growing faster than our systems" phase most companies hit around 20-100 employees.

The AI features genuinely accelerate content creation compared to building everything manually. The tracking and accountability tools actually get used, unlike those ambitious spreadsheets everyone swore they'd maintain. And the implementation support helps teams avoid the "bought expensive software, never fully adopted it" trap.

If you're tired of answering the same questions, watching new hires flounder for weeks, or worrying that critical knowledge disappears when someone quits, 👉 [give Trainual a serious look](https://trainual.com). The demo process is straightforward, they'll walk you through pricing specific to your team size, and you can typically see within the first conversation whether it clicks for your situation.

Not every tool works for every team, but for businesses hitting that awkward "too big for Google Docs, too small for enterprise everything" phase, Trainual hits a sweet spot that's hard to find elsewhere.
